Below is a brief description of the 5 projects:

## Qlik Tableau PowerBI
The project concerns the processing of descriptive analysis regarding the world of
football. In particular, the focus will be on statistics relating directly
to the on-field performance of footballers, such as goals and assists, and those
derived from them, such as market evaluations. Graphs will be presented,
dashboards and reports generated with three different Business Intelligence tools: **Qlik**,
**Tableau** and **Power BI**.

## Chatbot
Design, implementation and testing
of a chatbot, software that makes interaction between a human being
and a computer. Chatbots must be able to carry on a conversation
with a human being by receiving as input a voice, text or other form of
communication. A good chatbot is achieved when the human being
is not able to understand whether there is another person or a computer on the other side.
In our case, the chatbot is designed to provide information and
statistics on the world of football. In particular, the bot will have to be able to
understand and respond correctly to text messages sent by the user,
who may request data and statistics concerning footballers and teams. The
information for constructing the answers will be retrieved from Transfermarkt, the
best known and most reliable website for football and everything related to it.
football and everything related to it. The **RASA** framework will be used.

## Sentiment Analysis
Training of a NLP (Natural Language Processing) model on a
dataset containing film reviews, in order to distinguish positive from negative comments.
negative ones. A fine tuning operation will be carried out to prepare the
model to recognise the sentiment and then test it on test data, recording
and commenting on the results obtained. Google's open source **BERT** framework will be used.

## Social Network Analysis
The project concerns a Social Network Analysis (SNA) campaign
on a network of users of a Bitcoin exchange platform. Attention will be paid to
on the tools used and choices made in order to extract knowledge
and useful information from a social network, which characteristically has a chaotic structure.
a chaotic structure. The open source Python library **NetworkX** will be used.

## Classification, Clustering and Time Series Analysis
The project concerns the analysis of two datasets: the first contains
data concerning the cost of living in various cities around the world;
the second contains historical values of the shares of the distribution company
streaming of films and television series, Netflix, from 2012 to 2022.
Two different datasets were chosen because two different types of analysis will be carried out.
different types of analysis: the dataset on cities and their cost of living was chosen for the
the Clustering and Classification part, while the one containing information
relating to Netflix shares will be used for the time series analysis.
The above-mentioned analyses will be realised through the programming language
Python. The main reason for choosing this language is that
can be enriched and simplified through libraries specialised in these types of
of analyses such as **Pandas**, **Seaborn**, **Matplotlib**, **Scikitlearn** and **Statsmodels**.
